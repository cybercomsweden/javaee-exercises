= Exercise 2

== Build a REST interface using JAX-RS

In this exercise you are going to create your first JAX-RS application. 
Continue with the application you created in Exercise 1, or use the provided starting point found in this Exercise.

=== Part 1
Create a simple Hello resource that says hello to the caller.

|===
| Method | URI | Input | Output | Response code
| GET
| http://localhost:8080/exercise-2/api/hello/Duke
| n/a
| Hello Duke
| 200
|===

 public class HelloResource {
    // your code goes here
 }

=== Part 2
Create a REST API for a shopping list application. The following methods should be supported:

|===
| Method | URI | Input | Output | Response code

| GET
| http://localhost:8080/exercise-3/api/items
| n/a
| JSON item list
| 200

| POST
| http://localhost:8080/exercise-3/api/items
| JSON item
| n/a (URI in Location)
| 201

| GET
| http://localhost:8080/exercise-3/api/items/{id}
| n/a
| JSON item
| 200

| PUT
| http://localhost:8080/exercise-3/api/items/{id}
| JSON item
| n/a
| 200

| DELETE
| http://localhost:8080/exercise-3/api/items/{id}
| n/a
| n/a
| 200
|===

Model the resources using root and sub-resource. This is not really necessary, but added here for practice.

 public class ItemsResource {
    
    @Inject
    private ItemResource itemResource;
  
    // your code here
 }

 public class ItemResource {
   // your code here
 }

It is ok to hard code the responses in this exercise.
