= Exercise 3

== EJBs

In this exercise you are going to create an EJB and use it from the JAX-RS resource
you created in Exercise 2. Use the application you created there, or start with the solution provided here.

Create a Local, Stateless, Session Bean that expose the needed service methods needed by the resource(s) you created in 
Exercise 2. It must be possible to perform all operations supported by the API.

For this excercise it is ok to model the shopping list as a list of items
 
 private List<Item> shoppingList = new ArrayList<>();

When finished, you should be able to access your service through the REST api
